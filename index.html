					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Yo, my name’s Urvesh Parmar and I am an 18-year-old Fiji Indian. I was born in Lautoka Fiji, my mums’ side is from Fiji and my dads’ side is from India. I also have a younger brother who is 13 who was born here in Australia. I can speak and understand both Hindi and Gujarati, however, I cannot read or write in both. I graduated year 12 in 2020 from Dandenong High School, it was an interesting final year as it was the most important year and we had school mostly remotely due to the spicy cough, which made it quite difficult. I like to play video games and watch shows/movies or anime in my spare time. I played footy and cricket for the Parkmore Pirates and Noble Park up until about year 10. For whatever reason, not sure why, I used to roller skate when I was younger. I also participated in some competitions which included doing a routine where the judges would score you.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My main interest in IT is AI and a little bit of cybersecurity and programming. I find AI the most interesting branch of IT as I find it “cool” and because AI is becoming more prevalent now and will continue to be in the future. I have also recently gained an interest in animation and CGI type project, most likely because of the anime and CGI heavy shows and movies I like to watch. My interest in IT I think started when I was younger, and I started to play video games. From then I got interested in technology more and more. Also seeing an AI like Jarvis in Iron Man got me interested in AI when I was younger. Having also participated in the Vex Robotics Worlds Tournament in year 11 got me more interesting in AI/Robots, as well as programming since we had to program the robot for autonomous mode and manual control. I chose RMIT because it's one of the best universities in Australia and it focuses on courses around IT, which I have an interest in. Also, being able to travel to the city is a plus since Melbourne is a great city. After completing my IT degree, I hope to have learnt more about IT and ways I can apply it to the real world. Also, to learn and understand more about AI, programming, and cybersecurity. I hope that completing this degree that can also lead to a career in a successful career in IT, which is the end goal./p>

				<article>
					<h2>Software Developer</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>This job involves developing client-based plugins and cloud-based 3D rendering services for clients including property developments, product launches, marketing applications and project management. What makes this appealing is that it involves 3D rendering, which I find interesting. These jobs also state’s that they are looking for ways to improve and enhance their processes for animation, 3D modelling and media production through software automation. Software automation is like my interest in AI in that it relates to making something else do something for us. The job also says that they have an office both in Melbourne and in Tokyo and I have always thought of having the option to travel overseas for work and Japan was one of those countries.</p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>I currently only have some knowledge/experience with HTML.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>It is ideal to have an interest in 3D rendering technology and being proficient with C++ and C#. It is required to know C++/C#, DotNet/Windows API/COM, Git, Subversion. It is also beneficial experience in Revit/ArchiCAD/SketchUp add-on coding, HTML/JavaScript and Ruby, experience in any 3D/CAD environment either as a user or as a developer, AQS/Linux system management, PHP, and experience Iray.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>For the coding requirements I would see if this course offered it, if not I would try and take an extra small course or learn in my own time about the code. This would either be during my course or after it. For the other apps and requirements, I would do the same thing. I would try and take a micro-course if it's available and if not, I would try to do some self-learning on the subject.</p>

					<h2>Test Two</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences</p>
					<p>These results are what I expected from them, I knew I would be more of a visual learner. I also however did not expect there to be a close balance between the 3 learning styles. The influence this would have in a team would be that I would understand more of what we needed to if it were presented visually like a PowerPoint compared to the explanation being a readout to me like in a meeting. When forming teams, I would try and get people who are also more visual learners as it would easier to communicate with them and the cohesion would be better.</p>

				<article>
					<h2>Test Three</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Creativity Test</p>
					<p>These results are what I expected. I did not expect to be very creative and at the same time, I didn't expect to have no creativity, about the middle ground in terms of creativity. In a team, I would probably give some ideas on how to approach an issue and problems, but they would not be the most creative ones. For forming a team, I would work with people who have more creativity than me as having a creative team helps with solving problems and finding solutions.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My project is a medical app. This would include being able to store medical records as well as blood tests, keep track of appointments, a reminder for taking medication and for operations. It would also track your fitness and health over time in line with the medication if it impacts it. The main purpose would be to have an app that can hold all your medical-related stuff, so it is all in 1 app instead of having some physical documents go missing. You can also choose to share some or all that info with a family member or someone else as well as with your GP.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>As for as I know, I have not seen an app where it holds all medical records, or I just have not seen one yet. Also, both my parents go to the doctors often and have a blood test taken and they also both take medication. My dad came up with the idea where I should make an app that can store all your medical related stuff which can help a lot of people, whether they are in good health and do not go to the doctors much and especially for those who visit the doctors a lot.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>Medical records and blood tests/records - One of the main features of the app. You would be able to scan hard copy versions of medical records, like GP visits, hospital visits and other medical-related things. You would also be able to import digital medical records. Same as the medical records, you would be able to store digital copies and scan physical copies of blood tests and blood reports. Both can be sorted by whether it is from the GP or hospital, arranged according to date, which facility it was from specifically. You can also add your comments about the document. Appointments - You would be able to enter the appointments manually and it would look like a calendar. You could also import an appointment message and it can format it automatically the way the app wants it to. You can also set a reminder for when you want to be reminded about the appointment. You can also add comments to that appointment and there would be an option the make the appointment recurring, either every week or every 2 weeks. Medication - Another feature would be to keep track of your medication as well as have reminders. You can either manually type in or scan your medication form into the app. This will hold what medicine you are holding and keep track of any repeats you need to take. You can set daily reminders of when you want to take the medication and when to re-order your medication as well. You would also be able to categorise what the medication is for, e.g., you can group your basic Panadol and you can group your heart medication etc. Operations/Procedures - This feature would be for storing when you have an operation or procedure. This includes when the operation is, and any documents related to it. You can set a reminder for when you want to be notified and a reminder for when you can cancel the appointment at the latest. Health and Fitness - You would be able to enter your health and fitness details at the beginning. You can also add updates when you want or every week, you can then view your progress over time. This would mainly be for those whose medication and visits are healthrelated. It would show whether the medication and other activities your doing is helping with your health and fitness goals. Notifications - You can customise your notifications. By default, you would get notifications about everything: appointments, medication, procedures etc. You can also choose to send notifications to others as well by SMS or email. .</p>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>Would need software and programming to make the app itself, something like XCode, Swift, etc..</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>How to code and make the software for the app. Would need to know how to code both the app. It would not be hard to learn how to code. You can also learn how to code using and mobile software online or it's possible to take a course.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If it is successful and we make the app a reality, I would place it on both the Play Store and App Store. If it becomes more successful and has more users, I will try to expand to a website version of the app as well, made for those who prefer laptops overusing phones. If it is a success, the original problem of not having a place to store medical-related problems would be solved. Ultimately, it would help everyone who downloads the app with keeping all their medical-related things in one easy to use the app and never having to look everywhere for that one document or forgetting to take your medication..</p>
